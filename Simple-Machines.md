Simple Machines are cheaper versions of Ender IO's starting machines.  They are cheaper, but are less capable, slower, hold less energy, don't respond to redstone signals, and most slowly leak excess energy.

Tip: A [[Basic Capacitor Bank|Capacitor-Banks#basic-capacitor-bank]] doesn't require any alloys to craft, can limit its output, and reacts to a redstone signal. It can be used to mitigate energy loss.

# Simple Stirling Generator
(Image goes here)

Simple version of the [[Stirling Generator]].  It burns furnace fuels to generate power.  It generates 20 µI/t and produces 10 µI per unit of burn time (1 Coal produces 16,000 µI).  It holds up to 1,000 µI, but leaks 1 µI/t.  It is unable to use Lava Buckets.

# Simple Alloy Smelter
(Image goes here)

Simple version of the [[Alloy Smelter]].  It uses 10 µI/t when running, stores up to 1,000 µI, but leaks 1 µI/t constantly.  Unlike the normal Alloy Smelter, it cannot be used as a vanilla furnace.  It can only make Alloys.

# Simple SAG Mill
(Image goes here)

Simple version of the [[SAG Mill]].  It uses 10 µI/t when running, stores up to 1,000 µI, but leaks 1 µI/t constantly.  It is unable to use Grinding Balls.

# Simple Crafter
(Image goes here)

Simple version of the [[Crafter]].  It uses 10 µI/t when running and stores up to 10,000 µI.  Unlike the other Simple machines, it does not leak power.
