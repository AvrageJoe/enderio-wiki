Used to create EnderIO [[alloys]].  Can also be used as a powered furnace capable of processing up to three items at a time.  There is a button in the GUI to limit the machine to one of those operation types.

Upgrade with [[capacitors]] to increase speed and energy storage.  Speed is directly related to µI/t.
