Ender IO adds 5 different enchantments. They are made in the [[Enchanter]].

## Repellent

* Has 4 Levels
* Chance to teleport attackers away
* Higher levels teleport more often and farther

## Decay

* Applies withering to the target
* Applies to melee weapons

## Soulbound

* Note: Most gravestone mods are stupid and prevent this from working!

## Withering

* Applies withering to the target
* Applies to bows

## Shimmer

* Makes the item shimmer as if it was enchanted.
* That's all.
* Really.
* Nothing more.
