Crafting Component / Machine Upgrade

Basic capacitors are used to craft machines that use energy to operate. Double-layer and octadic capacitors act as machine upgrades for machines that have an upgrade slot. They increase energy storage and speed or range of machines.

Special capacitors with wildly varying properties can be found in loot chests.
