# Dark Pick
![](renders/dark_steel_pickaxe.png)

The Dark Pick is a pickaxe added by Ender IO.

It can be enchanted with any Pickaxe Enchantments (Vanilla or Modded).

It has a Harvest Level = 5 (equivalent to a Cobalt Pickaxe), but it can be configured to have a Harvest Level = 3 (equivalent to a Diamond Pickaxe), by switching canMineTiCArdite = false in enderio.cfg.
