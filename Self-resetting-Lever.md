Switches off after a certain time

The self-resetting lever comes in 4 types by default (up to 16 types can be configured in the config file): 10 seconds, 30 seconds, 1 minute and 5 minutes. It will behave and look exactly like a vanilla lever, but it will switch off by itself after the time that's in its name.
