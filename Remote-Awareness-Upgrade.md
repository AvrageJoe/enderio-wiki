Function upgrade for item conduits

Allows Inventory Panels attached to this network to see and extract items from this inventory independent of the conduit mode. (That means, there's no need to set the conduit to "extract".)

An Awareness Upgrade is **not** needed on conduits connecting to an Inventory Panel or Inventory System Storage.

It is also used to craft the [[Inventory Panel]], [[Inventory Sensors|Inventory Sensor]] and [[Inventory System Storage]].
