# Why are my conduits red?

Conduits go offline when they are partially in unloaded chunks. Then they are colored red.

## How do I fix that?

Make sure that conduit lines are completely in loaded chunks. You can employ chunk loader along the way or use [[Dimensional Transceiver]]s to not have a long line of conduits.

## Are red conduits bad?

No. They are just not working. It is no issue for your conduits to be red when you don't need them.
