_(Please note, above Images are from the old design of the blocks, and are not updated to the new ones for now!)_


The Inventory System blocks are a set of difering sized inventories to be used with the Inventory Pannel system, they cannot be opened by hand, but they have a invisible inventory that can be used by the Inventory Panel. They are connected via a data cable, BUT they will only connect if the system has been given a power supply!

Sadly not that much information is given at this moment of the exact sizes of each Storage block, but this may be updated to explain each storage size!
