The Inventory Panel is a machine which can be used to view and sort items throughout a set of storage blocks.  (Can be placed against a wall, or on the floor, facing up.)

The slightly grayed out area shows your items that are found within any storage space the machine is connected too, the return area acts as a mini-storage space, (it can also be made into that if you click the button next to the name.) This acts as a input for transporting items back to storage spaces.

For this machine to run you need a small set up of conduits, as well as a supply of 'Nutrient Distillation' which must be pumped into the Inventory Panel for it to function.

Now, once you're ready to set up a storage system, you need to have 'Data Conduits' and 'Item Conduits." Simply place down your data conduits first, and then place your Inventory Panel onto the conduit. (This  allows it to float, without a block to attach to the pannel will fall onto the ground.) Once your Panel is placed, connect any storage block like a chest, and it should be connected, finaly place 2 buckets of nutrient distillation into the panel and it should light up!

Now if anything is put into the storage items connected to the panel it will appear within its GUI. You can simply pull it out! But, how do you deal with bringing the items back? All you have to do is place item conduits between your Panel and your storage blocks, this gives you a chance to optionaly sort your items into storage blocks via a filter card! Make sure to set the item conduits to the right extract/insert mode!

When you have items stored inside of the Panel, you can craft using the top-left section of the GUI, if you want to fill the input slots with the same items found within your storage system for a recipe. (For example, more cobblestone for a furnace.) You can shift click the button that is next to the output slot for crafting to fill in those items. 

Finaly, there are a set of ( ? ) buttons that are on the side of the GUI, if you're about to craft a item, one of them will light up, you can save recipes for later, so you can simply click it to automatically pull those items needed for the recipe into the crafting GUI!


As a final note, here are some examples of the Panel working with other storage blocks from other mods.
(Pictured: Actually Additions crate, Iron chests... Iron chest, RF Tools Modular Storage and IC2s Steel Storage block.)
