# Capacitor Banks
Capacitor Banks store power.  Capacitor Banks of the same tier can connect into a free-form multiblock.  Each capacitor increases the total storage capacity, and the maximum transfer rate.

The Capacitor Bank GUI can set the Max Input (*2*) and Max Output (*3*), can react to a redstone signal to enable/disable energy input (*4*) and output (*5*) separately, and it can set the IO (*6*).  By mousing over the power bar (*1*) you can see precise statistics relating to current power, maximum power, and current net power gain or loss.

**The functionality that made its GUI have slots to charge µI items and allow quick access to the Armor, off-hand, and Baubles slots was removed in 1.12! Use the Simple Wired Charger and the Wired Charger for that!**

Each side of a Capacitor Bank can be changed by shift + right clicking it with an empty hand, or by right clicking with a [[Yeta Wrench]].  This can be used to show a power bar or screen with power input/output outside of the GUI.

## Creative Capacitor Bank

![](http://loenwind.info/eio/Creative_Capacitor_Bank.png)

Normally not craftable.  Cannot form a multiblock.  Is permanently set to contain 2,500,000 µI out of 5,000,000 and is capable of transferring 500,000 µI.  Energy can either be inserted (voided) or extracted (infinite supply).
