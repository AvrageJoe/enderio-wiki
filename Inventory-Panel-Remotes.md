Inventory Panel Remotes Are basically long range versions of the Inventory Panel, there are 3 versions, each acting as a upgrade to the previous.

To use any of these remotes, they must be 'connected' to a already existing panel connected to a network. Shift right clicking a remote onto the Panel will connect it.
Each type of remote must also be filled with energy and a liquid to function, the type of liquid it uses matters on the tier of the Remote. This liquid will also be consumed as well as a bit of energy with every time you open up the Remote, as well as interact with things like pull out items, place items in, etc.
