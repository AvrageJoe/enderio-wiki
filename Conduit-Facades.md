###Conduit Facade

Facades, once painted in a painting machine look like the block they were painted with, but can have conduits placed within them, allowing you to hide your conduits.  Regular facades do not hide conduits when the block it is painted with is smaller then the conduit bundle.  In this case a transparent conduit facade must be used instead.

### Hardened Conduit Facade

Similar to conduit facades, these are also somewhat blast resistant.
