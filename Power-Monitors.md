### Power Monitor

![](http://loenwind.info/eio/Power_Monitor.png)

The Power Monitor is used to show statistics related to power on an attached Conduit Network.  It must be touching an Ender IO [[Energy Conduit|Energy Conduits]].  You can see how much µI is stored in the Conduits, [[Capacitor Banks]], and Machines attached to the Conduit Network.  You can also see separate input and output µI/t for the network.

In addition, the Power Monitor features a redstone control system useful for controlling generators.  When the amount of µI in storage (Capacitor Banks) drops below a certain value, the Power Monitor will emit a redstone signal.  When the amount of µI in storage rises above another value, the redstone signal stops.  Both of those values are configurable, and the system has to be enabled by clicking the tick box in the top left corner.

The Power Monitor consumes 1 µI/t and stores up to 20,000 µI.

### Graphical Power Monitor

The Graphical Power Monitor includes all of the features of the normal Power Monitor, but also has a graph that shows the amount of µI in storage over time.  This graph is rendered in the GUI, and on the front of the block.
