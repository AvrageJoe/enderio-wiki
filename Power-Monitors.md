### Power Monitor

The Power Monitor is used to show statistics related to power on an attached Conduit Network.  It must be touching an Ender IO [[Energy Conduit|Energy Conduits]].  You can see how much µI is stored in the [[Conduits|Energy Conduits]] (*1*), [[Capacitor Banks]] (*2*), and Machines (*5*) attached to the Conduit Network.  You can also see separate input (*3*) and output (*4*) µI/t for the network.

In addition, the Power Monitor features a redstone control system useful for controlling generators.  When the amount of µI in storage (Capacitor Banks) drops below a certain value (*7*), the Power Monitor will emit a redstone signal.  When the amount of µI in storage rises above another value (*8*), the redstone signal stops.  Both of those values are configurable, and the system has to be enabled by clicking the tick box in the top left corner (*6*).

The Power Monitor consumes 5 µI/t and stores up to 1,000 µI.

### Graphical Power Monitor

The Graphical Power Monitor includes all of the features of the normal Power Monitor, but also has a graph that shows the amount of µI in storage over time.  This graph is rendered in the GUI (*10*), and on the front of the block. The time period described by the graph (*11*) can be set to different values: 10s, 1m, 10m, 1h, 10h, 24h, 7d.

The Graphical Power Monitor consumes 5 µI/t, and stores up to 1,000 µI/t (*9*).
