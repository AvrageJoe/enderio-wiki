(on a server) When Using the staff of traveling and clicking on an EnderIO Block the Client Crashes and says "A fatal error has occurred, Connection terminated"

I can use the EnderIO block from and anchor and it works tho sometimes it just teleports me.

Im running from Multi MC. Minecraft 1.7.10. EIO 2.1.0.233

I cant find a crash report.
Hope Fully this is enough info.
