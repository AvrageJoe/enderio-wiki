Ender IO's lang files are split just like the mod itself is. You will find them in:

* https://github.com/SleepyTrousers/EnderIO/tree/master/enderio-base/src/main/resources/assets/enderio/lang
* https://github.com/SleepyTrousers/EnderIO/tree/master/enderio-conduits/src/main/resources/assets/enderio/lang
* https://github.com/SleepyTrousers/EnderIO/tree/master/enderio-integration-forestry/main/resources/assets/enderio/lang
* https://github.com/SleepyTrousers/EnderIO/tree/master/enderio-integration-tic/src/main/resources/assets/enderio/lang
* https://github.com/SleepyTrousers/EnderIO/tree/master/enderio-machines/src/main/resources/assets/enderio/lang

All the "old" lang files which were made for 1.10.2 or an even older version have been removed. You can find the old files here:

* https://github.com/SleepyTrousers/EnderIO/tree/1.10/resources/assets/enderio/lang

Please note that there are a number of "guess" file which are automatically generated. They contain all keys that are needed (although they are in no good order) and try to guess which of the old translations may fit.

A word on the state of the en_us files: "integration-tic" and "integration-forestry" are done. "base" and "machines" should be quite stable. "conduits" may change dramatically. "invpanel" hasn't even been started.
