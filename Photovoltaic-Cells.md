Photovoltaic Cells generate power from sunlight.  They can connect horizontally as a free-form multiblock.  The amount of power they generate vary throughout the day, maxing out around noon.  They must have a clear line of sight to the sky.

There is a config option which determines if Photovoltaic Cells of different tiers can connect.  In 1.10 they default to allowing them to connect. In 1.7 and the upcoming 1.11 versions they default to not allowing them to connect to different tiers.
