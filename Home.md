Welcome to the EnderIO Git-Wiki!

### The Actual Wiki
To view the official wiki, go [here.] (http://wiki.enderio.com)

### Bugs
If you wish to raise a bug, please raise an issue in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/CrazyPants/EnderIO/issues).

Include as much information as you can, including the version of EnderIO and Minecraft. The more info the better, if I can't reproduce it, I probably can't fix it. Screen shots can be very helpful.

### Features
To view the features currently on the to-do list, and those being considered, go [here.](https://github.com/CrazyPants/EnderIO/wiki/Planned-Features).

### Feature Requests
If you wish to request a new feature please do the following:

1. Make sure it's not already on the planned features page.

2. Go to the [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/CrazyPants/EnderIO/issues) and check if somebody hasn't already requested it.

3. If you have done step 1 and 2 and it hasn't already been covered, raise a new issue.

4. Smile, you know you want to.

### Making me better
If you would like, you can contribute to the wiki. Fix my awesome typing/spelling, whatever.

Enjoy,
