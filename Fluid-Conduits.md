# Fluid Conduits

The Fluid Conduits transfer fluids between tanks.

## There are 3 types of Fluid Conduits:

### Fluid Conduit
![](http://loenwind.info/eio/Fluid_Conduit.png)

This is the first tier.

It has a Max Extract Speed of 50 mB/t.

It has Max IO: Speed of 200 mB/t.

It has configurable Redstone Mode.

**Its Fluid Flow Respects Gravity!**

*Its Flow Rate is dependent on Fluid Viscosity!*

### Pressurized Fluid Conduit
![](http://loenwind.info/eio/Pressurized_Fluid_Conduit.png)

This is the second tier.

It has a Max Extract Speed of 100 mB/t.

It has Max IO Speed of 400 mB/t.

It has configurable Redstone Mode.

### Ender Fluid Conduit

This is the third tier.

It has a Max Extract Speed of 200 mB/t.

It has Max IO Speed of 800 mB/t.

**It instantly teleports fluids between the conduit bundles(connections with tanks).**

**It allows multiple fluids to be transported on the same line.**

It also has extra options in its GUI that the other types don't: Channels(Insertion and Extraction), Priority(Insertion), Filter Upgrades(Insertion and Extraction), Round Robin(Extraction), Self Feed(Extraction), Function Upgrades(Extraction).

## The GUI of all Fluid conduits is split between their 2 modes: *insert* and *extract*. These modes can be toggled independently.

### Insert

Insertion can be configured in these ways:

#### Channels (*1*) (Ender Fluid Conduits only)

Channels are used to split a single fluid conduit network into multiple networks that act independently.

There are 16 different channels. Each of them has a different color, corresponding to the 16 minecraft colors: 

Green, Brown, Blue, Purple, Cyan, Light Gray, Gray, Pink, Lime, Yellow, Light Blue, Magenta, Orange, White, Black

#### Priority (*2*) (Ender Fluid Conduits only)

The insertion uses the priority system. The priority is represented by an integer.

*The fluids will be inserted into the tanks with the highest priority first.*

#### Filter Upgrades (*3*) (Ender Fluid Conduits only)

Insertion can be filtered. There is a single slot for filters.

### Extract

Extraction can be configured in these ways:

#### Channels (*4*) (Ender Fluid Conduits only)

Channels are used to split a single fluid conduit network into multiple networks that act independently.

There are 16 different channels. Each of them has a different color, corresponding to the 16 minecraft colors: 

Green, Brown, Blue, Purple, Cyan, Light Gray, Gray, Pink, Lime, Yellow, Light Blue, Magenta, Orange, White, Black

#### Round Robin (*5*) (Ender Fluid Conduits only)

If Round Robin is disabled, fluids will be inserted normally, Nearest-First, into the tanks with the highest priority.

If Round Robin is enabled, fluids will be split equally between the tanks with the highest priority.

#### Self Feed (*6*) (Ender Fluid Conduits only)

Normally, Ender Fluid Conduits will not try to put fluids directly back into the block or machine they extracted them from. Switching on "Self Feed" will enable them to do so.

#### Redstone Mode (*7*) (All Fluid Conduits)

Controls when the extraction should happen in regards to *Redstone Signal*. It can be set to these modes:

##### Always active
Extraction is always active, ignoring redstone signal.

##### Active with signal
Extraction only happens if the conduit receives a redstone signal(power 1-15).

If the redstone signal is transmitted by a redstone conduit, the Signal Color can be set.

##### Active without signal
Extraction only happens if the conduit doesn't receive a redstone signal(power 0).

If the redstone signal is transmitted by a redstone conduit, the Signal Color can be set.

##### Never active
Extraction is never active, ignoring redstone signal.

#### Filter Upgrades (*8*) (Ender Fluid Conduits only)

Extraction can be filtered. There is a single slot for filters.

#### Function Upgrades (*9*) (Ender Fluid Conduits only)

The Speed of the Extraction can be modified using *Speed Upgrades* and *Speed Downgrades*.

By default, ender fluid conduits have an extraction speed of 200 mB/t, which represents 100%.

There's an info button (*10*) in the GUI that shows the *Effective Speed* while Hovering.

##### Speed Upgrades
![](http://loenwind.info/eio/Item_Conduit_Speed_Upgrade.png)

Every added Speed Upgrade increases extraction speed by 100%.

*The Maximum Amount of Speed Upgrades that can be added in a fluid conduit is 15*, for a maximum extraction speed of 3200 mB/t!

##### Speed Downgrades
![](http://loenwind.info/eio/Item_Conduit_Speed_Downgrade.png)

*The Maximum Amount of Speed Downgrades that can be added in a fluid conduit is 3!*

**1 added Speed Downgrade decreases extraction speed to 25% fluid per operation(*THE MINIMUM EXTRACTION SPEED = 50 mB/t*).**

**2 added Speed Downgrades decrease extraction speed to 50% fluid per operation(= 100 mB/t).**

**3 added Speed Downgrades decrease extraction speed to 75% fluid per operation(= 150 mB/t).**


Note:

mB = milibuckets = 1/1000 Buckets

IO = Input/Output
